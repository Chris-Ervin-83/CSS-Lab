        <h2>To Kill a Mockingbird</h2>
        <p><span>Mockingbird</span>To Kill a Mockingbird takes place in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama, during
            the Great Depression. The
            protagonist is Jean Louise (“Scout”) Finch, an intelligent though unconventional girl who ages from six to
            nine
            years old during the course of the novel. She is raised with her brother, Jeremy Atticus (“Jem”), by their
            widowed father, Atticus Finch. He is a prominent lawyer who encourages his children to be empathetic and
            just.
            He notably tells them that it is “a sin to kill a mockingbird,” alluding to the fact that the birds are
            innocent
            and harmless.</p>
